## Current Contributing info

This GitHub repo was originally found from [this techrepublic article](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/microsoft-reanimates-corpse-of-maligned-office-assistant-clippy-to-help-teams-compete-with-slack/)
and related [HN article](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19451754). But after that,
[original repo](https://github.com/OfficeDev/microsoft-teams-clippy-app) seems to be not
available anymore. If original repo will sometime come available again, xet7 is happy to
contribute all changes as pull requests to upstream repo, or if given upstream repo access,
merge and maintain original repo, to check and merge pull requests from community.

Because original repo is not available, it makes signing CLA of original repo impossible.
So currently this repo uses original MIT license without CLA.
